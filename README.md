# Invisible-Me

Is there anyone who don't know about "Harry Potter's Invisible Cloak" ? No!!
Wonderful!! Everyone knows about it. In this post, I have created my own invisible cloak by using techniques of image processing called color detection and segmentation. To run this code on your system, you must have a video with .mp4 extension and a mono-color cloth. I used a red color cloth. You can use any other color also but then you will have to modify the upper and lower range of mask. 

<strong>Algorithm</strong>

1. Capture and store the background frame.
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.
4. Generate the final output to get a magical effect.
